# Pictures AR for Android #

This is a simple example of an Android application which uses the code that I realized for my Computer Vision course project at Ca' Foscari university.

The application is a simple AR software that replaces two markers with the pictures related to them.

In particular Van marker will be substituted with Van Gohg's picture and Leo with Leonardo's picture.
